# E07a-Particles
Completed the assignment. This assignment was great because it had a really nice explanation for everything. It was also nice just messing with the different value to see exactly how they affected each other. I chose to make rain so I inverted the direction and offset the x value for the particles by -200 so you can have a nice long line of rain, otherwise it just looks like a faucet. I changed the colors fron red and teal to a couple shades of blue for the final touches. Really enjoyed this one!
